## How to set up

To set up the bot it was made as simple as possible.

### `config.json` file

There is [`config.json`](config.json) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                  | What it is                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE      | The prefix you want to use for normal commands |
| YOUR_BOT_INVITE_LINK_HERE | The link to invite the bot                     |

### `.env` file

To set up the token you will have to either make use of the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file, either copy or rename it to `.env` and replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your bot's token.

Alternatively you can simply create an environment variable named `TOKEN`.

## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows), or your Command Prompt (
Windows)
.

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
Followed by
```
conda activate recommender_discord_bot
```

After that you can start it with

```

> **Note** You may need to replace `python` with `py`, `python3`, `python3.12`, etc. depending on what Python versions you have installed on the machine.
